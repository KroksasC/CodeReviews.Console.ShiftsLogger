<h1>ShiftsLogger</h1>

This application is a part of the www.thecsharpacademy.com roadmap.<br>
Goal of the website is to become a (better) C# and .Net developper.<br>
<br>
<h2>About the project:</h2>
This project exists out of two parts that combines what we taught in the last 2 projects.<br>
The first part is creating a web API. <br>
And the second part is an console application UI that calls our API<br>
The app allows the user to enter an employee name, the start time of their shift and the end time of their shift. <br>
The app calculates the duration between the start and the end of the shift and stores all this info in a SQL database.<br>
Users can create, see, update and delete the records.<br>
<br>
<h2>Requirements:</h2>
- Create the API first and test it with swagger and postman before starting on the UI part<br>
- Use Entitiy Framework and SQL server.<br>
- Database needs to be created the 'Code First' approach.<br>
- All validation and userinput need to happen in the UI
<br>
<h2>Lessons learned:</h2>
- First time creating an API, it wasn't that hard to create this basic API.<br>
- Testing with Swagger and Postman.<br>
- Learn more about calling an API and using Http requests.<br>
- Learned about using async Tasks and await statements.<br>

<br>
<h2>Resources used:</h2>
- The assignment page and discord channel of www.thecsharpacademy.com <br>
- Microsoft docs<br>
- Various google and youtube searches about Http requests and using Swagger/Postman.<br>
- Asked ChatGPT to clarify some things for better understanding.<br>
